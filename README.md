# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to provide insights regarding how city type (urban, suburban, and rural) impacts ride habits. To complete this, I need to create a summary Data-Frame by reading in ride and city data. This will allow me to present an analysis of ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). Through the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy, my goal is to create a multi-line graph which shows the total weekly fares by city type. This will allow me to display how city type creates nuances for the key decision makers of the PyBer organization. 

Results:
- How is the district summary affected?
  - As shown below, the district summary is not significantly effected by the change. This metric takes into account the entire district, so the removal of one ninth grade class from one school only slighlty reduces the average math score, passing reading rate, passing math rate, and overall passing rate.
