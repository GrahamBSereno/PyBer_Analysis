# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to provide insights regarding how city type (urban, suburban, and rural) impacts ride habits. To complete this, I need to create a summary Data-Frame by reading in ride and city data. This will allow me to present an analysis of ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). Through the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy, my goal is to create a multi-line graph which shows the total weekly fares by city type. This will allow me to display how city type creates nuances for the key decision makers of the PyBer organization. 

## Results:
As shown in the below data frame, the urban city type has the most rides, drivers, and total fares. Due to this high frequency and availablity, the urban city types bring in the lowest average fare per ride and lowest averge fare per driver. The suburban city type is not the highest in any category yet provides a significant boost in average fare per ride and average fare per driver if you compare against the urban counterpart. Finally, the rural city type is the lowest in terms of rides, drivers, and fares. Due to the low frequency and availability, average fare per ride and average fare per rider are highest in rural areas.

The multi-line graphical representation below shows that the suburban types strikes the optimal balance between total rides and average fare per ride which yields the highest total fares.

## Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Invest in the suburban city type as this provides the optimal balance between total rides and average fare per ride.
2. Consider adding a surge fee for urban areas to increase average fare per ride during peak hours.
3. Consider further marketing in rural areas to increase total rides. The rural city type draws in the highest fare per ride.
